    <p>Total up the numbers from 1 to 1000</p>
    <script>
        var num = 0;
        var total = 0;

    <p>A loop is a construct that allows you to repeat a block of code.</p>
    <h2>Two types of loops</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Definate Loop - known number of repetition</li>
        <li>Indefinate loop - unknown number of repetitions</li>
    </ul>
